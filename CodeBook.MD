Introduction and process description
====================================

The "tidy.txt" dataset is based on the original dataset of the http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Based on the above dataset, the current tidy one is built as follows:

1. The training dataset and the test dataset were merged
2. Each record has the subjectID and the Activity description added to it
3. For the 33 measurements the mean() and std() were selected, and for each of the 66 variables, the average was calculated for each subject and each activity.
4. The resulting data set has 180 records (30 subjects * 6 activities) and 68 columns as described below.

Dataset Description
=====================

The dataset has a header row.

The 68 variables as as follows. The measurement description for variables 3 to 68 are in the original dataset referred above.

The VALUE for each of these variables is the average for each subject and each activity

Variables
=========
"Subject" - the ID of the subject measured
"Activity" - a character string describing the activity. There are 6 activities:
	WALKING
	WALKING_UPSTAIRS
	WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
	SITTING
	STANDING
	LAYING
